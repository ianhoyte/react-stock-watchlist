## About

This is the headway for the stocks watchlist assessment.  Some current features showcase sign up and sign in, firebase database logging and authentication for a userbase. Each user can create a watchlist which is saved to the database.  A user can currently create and delete a watchlist. A user can add "stocks" to each watchlist, however, the entries are currently overwritten as the concatenation between front end and the database has not yet been completed.

## Installation

* `npm i` installs the dependencies
* `npm start` starts the project
* You will also need an .env file to connect to the firebase DB which can be placed in the project's root

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
